## Participant information

You are being invited to take part in research to investigate experts' views of mathematical proof.

We need to ask your permission to include your responses in published research. Before you decide to take part it is important you understand why the research is being conducted and what it will involve. Please take time to read the following information carefully.

This study is being run by Prof Chris Sangwin and Dr George Kinnear, from the School of Mathematics at the University of Edinburgh.

* **What is the purpose of the study?**

  To better understand what characteristics expert mathematicians value when considering the relative merits of different mathematical proofs.

* **Why have I been invited to take part?**

  You are invited to participate in this study because you are an expert mathematician.

* **Do I have to take part?**

  No â€“ it is entirely up to you. If you do decide to take part, please keep a copy of this Information Sheet and complete the Informed Consent to show that you understand your rights in relation to the research, and that you are happy to participate.

* **What will happen if I decide to take part?**

  You will be asked to conduct a series of paired comparisons of mathematical proofs. In each comparison you will be asked to read two proofs of a given theorem in mathematics and to choose one.

* **What are the possible benefits of taking part?**

  By taking part you will be helping the research team better understand what experts value in mathematical proof.  We anticipate this will enable us, and others, to improve the design mathematics teaching in future.

* **Are there any risks associated with taking part?**

  There are no significant risks associated with participation.

* **What if I want to withdraw from the study?**

  We do not collect any personally identifiable information, so it is not possible for us to identify responses from an individual participant. This means it is not possible for you to withdraw from the study after you have submitted your answers. 

* **What will happen with the results of this study?**

  The results of this study may be summarised in published articles, reports and presentations. Quotes or key findings will always be made anonymous in any formal outputs unless we have your prior and explicit written permission to attribute them to you by name. Information may also be kept for future research.

* **Who can I contact?**

  If you have any further questions about the study, please contact Prof. Christopher Sangwin (C.J.Sangwin@ed.ac.uk).

  If you wish to make a complaint about the study, please contact Professor Ivan Cheltsov (Director of Research, School of Mathematics, I.Cheltsov@ed.ac.uk).  In your communication, please provide the study title ("Experts' views of mathematical proof") and detail the nature of your complaint.

### Data Protection and Confidentiality

Your data will be processed in accordance with Data Protection Law.  All information collected about you will be kept strictly confidential. We will anonymise all data before carrying out any analysis. The anonymised data will be made available on the OSF website (osf.io) for possible further research.
